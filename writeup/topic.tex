\section{Course Topics}

We used the idea of bounded verfication from the course. Here, we 
limit the number of columns and number of symbolic rows an input
table have. We use the solver aided language Rosette covered by 
the course the build our verification tool. The underlying workhorse
for our verification tool is Z3, a SMT solver that also covered by 
the course.
